# techtool

A simple tool designed to allow users to create files which can be saved to the server the tool is running on. HTML files, etc., can then be accessed live. Created for use while teaching HTML, to allow students to create live web pages.

Uses Google OAuth to allow users to sign in and save files under a specific account. MySQL is used to interact with a database to store info about what files were created by each account used.
